## About This Project

This portfolio website is part of my learning journey as I explore how to build and design websites. It showcases the work I’ve completed, the skills I’ve developed, and the progress I’ve made throughout the course. The project allowed me to practice creating a functional and visually appealing site while learning how to organize and present my work online.

## What I Learned

* How to structure and build a website using HTML and CSS.

* How to improve the appearance and layout of a site using responsive design techniques.

* How to publish a website online using GitHub Pages and manage updates through GitHub.

## Next Steps

If I had more time, I would add a new interactive JavaScript-based feature to my portfolio—such as a dynamic project gallery, a light/dark mode toggle, or animated page transitions—to make the user experience more engaging and modern.
